# About Papatya
Papatya is an open source free tool for creating neural networks and running them without coding. It will be fully GUI based and could be usable by any user even if the user never tried neural networks before. Tensorflow2 Keras will be used on the backside. It is on development right now.

### Edit:
I realised that building this kind of functionalities on GUI is very hard for me to handle right now. So I decided to create a python library that consist of data manupilation tools at the beginnig, than I will move to AI functionalities and GUI.
